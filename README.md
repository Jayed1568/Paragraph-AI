# 🧠 ParagraphAI — Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on Structured Prompt-Completion Pairs

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model using a custom dataset of student-written paragraphs. The dataset is structured as prompt → completion pairs, allowing the model to learn controlled, topic-specific text generation. Training and inference are performed in Google Colab using Hugging Face's Transformers and Datasets libraries.

---

## 📁 Repository Contents

* `ParagraphAI.ipynb` — The complete Google Colab notebook with all code for preprocessing, fine-tuning, and text generation.
* `Paragraphs.txt` — Raw dataset file containing paragraphs separated by `---`.
* `training_log.csv` — Training log file with loss values for each step.
* `data.jsonl` — (Optional/Not used) JSONL file version of the dataset for other applications.
* `prompt_completion_dataset.csv` — Exported DataFrame containing all cleaned and parsed prompt → completion pairs.

---

## 💡 Project Highlights

* **Model**: Fine-tunes `gpt2` from Hugging Face's `openai-community/gpt2` checkpoint.
* **Objective**: Generate coherent, structured paragraphs from educational-style prompts.
* **Training Strategy**:

  * Input: `"### PROMPT:\n<user_prompt>\n\n### COMPLETION:\n<expected_response>"`
  * Epochs: 3
  * Batch Size: 2
  * Mixed Precision: Enabled (FP16)
* **Logging**: Loss metrics logged using Hugging Face Trainer; available in `training_log.csv`.
* **Text Generation**: Model generates completions for unseen prompts using the trained checkpoint.

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

In Google Colab:

```bash
!pip install pandas transformers datasets
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Upload `Paragraphs.txt` in Colab.
2. Run `ParagraphAI.ipynb` to:

   * Parse the dataset
   * Tokenize using GPT-2 tokenizer
   * Fine-tune GPT-2 with prompt-completion formatted inputs
3. Generate new completions using:

   ```python
   generate_text("What are the effects of air pollution?")
   ```

---

## 🧪 Example Output

```text
Prompt: What are the effects of air pollution?

Completion:
Air pollution causes severe health problems including respiratory diseases...
```

> 📌 Include output screenshots in the report or directly in this README under `/screenshots`.

## 📊 Results

* Loss decreased steadily over training epochs (see `training_log.csv`).
* The model successfully generalizes across various writing styles (opinion, informative, descriptive).
* See the project report for detailed performance summary and challenges.
